  # Five-Hour Limit, Get Lost!

  **A lightweight, local-first Windows scheduler for unfinished Codex tasks.**

  <p>
    Watch the tasks you already have · wait for the next allowance · resume when it is safe to try again

## Why this exists

Long-running coding work should not stop just because a five-hour allowance is temporarily exhausted. **Five-Hour Limit, Get Lost!** keeps an eye on an existing local Codex task and retries it after the next reset window.

It does not create new chats, use a remote service, bypass limits, or modify Codex permissions. It is a small Windows companion that automates the boring “check again later” step.

## At a glance

| | Design choice |
| --- | --- |
| **Scope** | Existing Codex tasks only; no new task creation |
| **Runtime** | Native Windows PowerShell + WinForms |
| **Scheduling** | Confirmed same-session limit detection or a predictable `+5 hours` cycle |
| **Clock** | Windows local system clock; no Internet time service |
| **Storage** | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexQueueCN\` on the current user profile |
| **Permissions** | No administrator privileges required |
| **Network** | No server, telemetry, API key, or remote dependency |

## Highlights

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>🧭 <b>Monitor existing work</b><br />Discover recent local Codex sessions instead of asking you to recreate a task.</td>
    <td>⏱️ <b>Two scheduling modes</b><br />Use local reset information when available, or choose a single time and repeat every five hours.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>🛡️ <b>Safe retries</b><br />Keep the original session ID, wait when another Codex process owns it, and use a configurable reset buffer.</td>
    <td>🧹 <b>Simple queue controls</b><br />See status and next-run time, right-click to remove one record, or clear the monitor list.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>📦 <b>Portable source release</b><br />Run from a downloaded folder; the installer only creates a desktop shortcut.</td>
    <td>🔎 <b>Transparent behavior</b><br />See reset evidence, ownership conflicts, retry times, and saved Codex output; dangerous modes are not enabled automatically.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Existing Codex task] --> B[Discover local session]
    B --> C[Add to monitor list]
    C --> D{Allowance available?}
    D -- Yes --> E[Resume with local codex.exe]
    D -- No --> F[Wait for reset + safety buffer]
    F --> E
    E --> G{Task finished?}
    G -- Yes --> H[Mark complete]
    G -- No / limit hit --> F
```

The scheduler only runs while its window is open (it can be minimized). Finished tasks are not started again. Automatic mode requires an explicit limit failure for that session plus a matching five-hour reset record; ordinary usage telemetry alone never starts a task. When Codex reports that the original session has another active writer, the scheduler keeps its ID and retries after 15, 30, then 60 seconds. It never kills an unowned Codex process. If an external Codex host keeps the session open, release it there; the scheduler shows the wait and continues checking.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11.
- Windows PowerShell 5.1, included with supported Windows versions.
- Codex installed and signed in for the current Windows user.
- The local `codex.exe` CLI available on `PATH`, or in the standard Codex installation directory under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenAI\Codex\bin`.

## Quick start

### 1. Install

Download or clone this repository. In the project folder, run:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
```

The installer creates a **Five-Hour Limit, Get Lost!** shortcut on the current user's Desktop. It does not require administrator privileges.

Prefer no shortcut? Double-click:

```text
start-five-hour-limit-get-lost.bat
```

### 2. Add a task to the monitor

1. Open or run the task once in Codex so it exists in the local session list.
2. Open the scheduler and click **刷新任务**.
3. Select the existing task.
4. Choose a scheduling mode.
5. Click **开始监控**.

### 3. Choose a scheduling mode

| Mode | Best for | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **自动检测（读取本地日志）** | The original session log records both a limit failure and a five-hour reset | Reads only the selected session; a reset value without a matching failure does not trigger a resume. |
| **手动五小时循环** | The local log does not record a readable limit event | Pick one `HH:mm` time. The scheduler repeats it every five hours and waits the configured buffer before retrying. |

Example: choosing `20:32` produces `20:32 → 01:32 → 06:32 → 11:32 → 16:32 → 21:32`.

The default safety buffer is two minutes. The clock and schedule use the Windows local time; this project does not query an Internet clock.

## Queue controls

- **刷新任务** — read recent sessions from the current Windows profile.
- **开始监控** — add or update the selected existing session in the local monitor list.
- **一键全删** — remove all monitor records; it does not delete Codex tasks or project files.
- **右键 → 删除此监控任务** — remove one monitor record.
- **右键 → 查看错误详情与日志** — inspect the failure category, exit code, original session ID, and local run log.
- **右键 → 核对后重试原会话** — explicitly retry a result that needs attention; check the old session first because an uncertain prior submission could have succeeded.
- **暂停** — stop starting new work while keeping the queue visible.

An “等待原会话释放” row means Codex rejected the attempt because another process is writing that session. The scheduler retries the same UUID. If the other owner is a desktop or IDE session that remains open, release that session through its host. The scheduler does not terminate the shared Codex host.

## Privacy first by design

All state and run output remain on the local machine:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexQueueCN\
```

The application:

- does not send telemetry or contact a remote service;
- does not use OpenAI API keys;
- does not read Claude data;
- does not upload prompts, transcripts, project files, or logs;
- does not bypass, extend, or manipulate Codex limits.

Do not commit the local state directory or unredacted run logs to a public repository.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>No tasks appear after refreshing</b></summary>

Open or run the task in Codex once, then click **刷新任务** again. The scheduler reads recent sessions from the current user's `.codex` directory; it cannot see tasks belonging to another Windows account.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Codex cannot be started</b></summary>

Confirm Codex is installed and signed in. The scheduler checks both `PATH` and the standard `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenAI\Codex\bin` location. Restart the scheduler after installing or updating Codex.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Automatic detection does not find the reset</b></summary>

Local transcript formats can change between Codex releases. Switch to **手动五小时循环（推荐）**, choose the next expected reset time, and leave the two-minute buffer enabled.
